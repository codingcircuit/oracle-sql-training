# Hierarchical Queries in Oracle SQL

## Overview

Hierarchical queries in Oracle SQL are used to manage and query hierarchical data. They are particularly useful for data that is organized in a tree-like structure, such as organizational charts or file systems.

Oracle SQL supports hierarchical queries using the `CONNECT BY` clause, which allows you to specify parent-child relationships within the data. This can be complemented by the `START WITH` clause to define the root of the hierarchy.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **START WITH**

The `START WITH` clause specifies the root of the hierarchy. It is used to define which rows are considered the starting point for the hierarchical query.

**Example 1:**

Retrieve employees and their managers starting with the employee whose ID is 1:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, manager_id, LEVEL
FROM employees
START WITH emp_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = manager_id;
```

**Example 2:**

Display all departments starting with a specific department ID:

```sql
SELECT department_name, parent_department_id, LEVEL
FROM departments
START WITH department_id = 10
CONNECT BY PRIOR department_id = parent_department_id;
```

**Example 3:**

Get all nodes in an organizational chart starting with the CEO:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, manager_id, LEVEL
FROM employees
START WITH employee_id = 1001 -- CEO ID
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
```

### 2. **CONNECT BY**

The `CONNECT BY` clause defines the parent-child relationship between rows. It determines how rows are connected in the hierarchy.

**Example 1:**

Display the hierarchy where the `emp_id` column is used to define parent-child relationships:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, manager_id, LEVEL
FROM employees
START WITH emp_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = manager_id;
```

**Example 2:**

Show product categories and subcategories using parent-child relationships:

```sql
SELECT category_name, parent_category_id, LEVEL
FROM product_categories
START WITH parent_category_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR category_id = parent_category_id;
```

**Example 3:**

Retrieve the organizational structure with employees and their managers:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, manager_id, LEVEL
FROM employees
START WITH employee_id = 200
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
```

### 3. **LEVEL**

The `LEVEL` pseudo-column indicates the level of a row in the hierarchy. It starts with 1 for the root and increases by 1 for each level down the hierarchy.

**Example 1:**

Show the level of each employee in the hierarchy:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, manager_id, LEVEL
FROM employees
START WITH emp_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = manager_id;
```

**Example 2:**

Display the hierarchy of departments with their levels:

```sql
SELECT department_name, parent_department_id, LEVEL
FROM departments
START WITH department_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR department_id = parent_department_id;
```

**Example 3:**

Get all tasks and their levels in a project:

```sql
SELECT task_name, parent_task_id, LEVEL
FROM project_tasks
START WITH parent_task_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR task_id = parent_task_id;
```

### 4. **PRIOR**

The `PRIOR` keyword is used to refer to the parent row in the hierarchical query. It helps to specify the relationship between parent and child rows.

**Example 1:**

Retrieve employees and their direct reports:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, manager_id
FROM employees
START WITH emp_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = manager_id;
```

**Example 2:**

Show the hierarchy of file systems with parent-child relationships:

```sql
SELECT file_name, parent_id
FROM file_system
START WITH parent_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR file_id = parent_id;
```

**Example 3:**

List all products and their sub-products:

```sql
SELECT product_name, parent_product_id
FROM products
START WITH parent_product_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR product_id = parent_product_id;
```

### 5. **SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH**

The `SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH` function returns the path from the root node to the current node. It helps to visualize the hierarchy.

**Example 1:**

Show the path of each employee from the root of the hierarchy:

```sql
SELECT emp_name, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(emp_name, ' -> ') AS path
FROM employees
START WITH emp_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = manager_id;
```

**Example 2:**

Display the full path of product categories:

```sql
SELECT category_name, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(category_name, ' > ') AS path
FROM product_categories
START WITH parent_category_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR category_id = parent_category_id;
```

**Example 3:**

Visualize the path of departments in an organizational structure:

```sql
SELECT department_name, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(department_name, ' / ') AS path
FROM departments
START WITH parent_department_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR department_id = parent_department_id;
```

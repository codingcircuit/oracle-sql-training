# 4. SET Operators

SET operations in Oracle SQL allow you to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set. The primary SET operations are `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` (or `MINUS` in Oracle SQL). These operations are useful for querying multiple tables or result sets and combining them in various ways.

## 1. UNION

The `UNION` operator combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows from the result.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT first_name FROM contractors;
```
This example retrieves a list of unique first names from both the `employees` and `contractors` tables.

## 2. UNION ALL

The `UNION ALL` operator combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set, including duplicates.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name FROM contractors;
```
This example retrieves a list of all first names from both the `employees` and `contractors` tables, including duplicates.

## 3. INTERSECT

The `INTERSECT` operator returns the rows that are common to the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
INTERSECT
SELECT first_name FROM contractors;
```
This example retrieves the first names that appear in both the `employees` and `contractors` tables.

## 4. MINUS (EXCEPT in SQL Server)

The `MINUS` (or `EXCEPT` in SQL Server) operator returns the rows that are in the result set of the first `SELECT` statement but not in the result set of the second `SELECT` statement.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
MINUS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT first_name FROM contractors;
```
This example retrieves the first names that are in the `employees` table but not in the `contractors` table.

## Important Points

- **Column Matching**: For SET operations to work, the number and data types of the columns in the `SELECT` statements must match.
- **Ordering**: The result set of a `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operation can be ordered using the `ORDER BY` clause. The `ORDER BY` clause must be used at the end of the entire query, not in the individual `SELECT` statements.
- **Performance**: `UNION ALL` is generally faster than `UNION` because it does not require the removal of duplicates.

## Examples with Ordering

### UNION with Ordering
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT first_name FROM contractors
ORDER BY first_name;
```
This example retrieves a unique list of first names from both tables and orders the results alphabetically.

### UNION ALL with Ordering
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name FROM contractors
ORDER BY first_name;
```
This example retrieves all first names, including duplicates, from both tables and orders the results alphabetically.

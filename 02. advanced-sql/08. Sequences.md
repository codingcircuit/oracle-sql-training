# 8. Sequences

A **sequence** in Oracle SQL is a database object that generates a sequence of unique numbers. Sequences are often used for creating unique primary key values and ensuring that values are unique across rows. They are particularly useful for generating identifiers for rows in a table.

## 1. What is a Sequence?

A sequence is a schema object that generates a sequence of integers according to specified parameters. The primary purpose of a sequence is to provide a mechanism for generating unique numeric values, which can be used for various purposes, such as primary keys.

### Key Features

- **Unique Values**: Ensures that each value generated is unique.
- **Incremental Values**: Values are generated sequentially, usually incremented by a defined amount.
- **Customizable**: You can configure the starting value, increment, and other parameters.

## 2. Creating a Sequence

To create a sequence, use the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
[START WITH start_value]
[INCREMENT BY increment_value]
[MINVALUE min_value]
[MAXVALUE max_value]
[CYCLE | NOCYCLE]
[CACHE cache_size | NOCACHE];
```

### Parameters

- **START WITH**: Specifies the starting value of the sequence.
- **INCREMENT BY**: Specifies the increment between sequence numbers.
- **MINVALUE**: Specifies the minimum value the sequence can generate.
- **MAXVALUE**: Specifies the maximum value the sequence can generate.
- **CYCLE**: Specifies that the sequence will restart from the beginning once the maximum value is reached.
- **NOCYCLE**: Specifies that the sequence will not restart after reaching the maximum value.
- **CACHE**: Specifies the number of sequence numbers to cache in memory for faster access.
- **NOCACHE**: Specifies that no sequence numbers should be cached.

### Example

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE employee_seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1
MINVALUE 1
MAXVALUE 1000
NOCYCLE
CACHE 20;
```

## 3. Using a Sequence

To obtain the next value from a sequence, use the `NEXTVAL` pseudocolumn. To get the current value, use the `CURRVAL` pseudocolumn.

### Example: Retrieving the Next Value

```sql
SELECT employee_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;
```

### Example: Retrieving the Current Value

```sql
SELECT employee_seq.CURRVAL FROM dual;
```

Note: `CURRVAL` can only be used after `NEXTVAL` has been called in the same session.

## 4. Altering a Sequence

To modify an existing sequence, use the `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE sequence_name
[RESTART WITH new_start_value]
[INCREMENT BY new_increment_value]
[MAXVALUE new_max_value]
[MINVALUE new_min_value]
[CYCLE | NOCYCLE]
[CACHE cache_size | NOCACHE];
```

### Example

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE employee_seq
INCREMENT BY 10
MAXVALUE 2000
CACHE 50;
```

## 5. Dropping a Sequence

To remove a sequence from the database, use the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement.

### Example

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE employee_seq;
```

## 6. Practical Uses of Sequences

### Example 1: Using Sequences for Primary Keys

When inserting data into a table, sequences are commonly used to generate unique values for primary keys.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (employee_seq.NEXTVAL, 'John', 'Doe');
```

### Example 2: Generating Unique Identifiers

Sequences can be used to generate unique identifiers for other purposes, such as order numbers.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_number NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_number, order_date)
VALUES (order_seq.NEXTVAL, SYSDATE);
```

## 1. Introduction

Recursive queries in Oracle SQL allow querying hierarchical data structures and performing recursive operations. These queries are typically implemented using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with the `WITH` clause.

## 2. Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Basic Structure

A recursive CTE is composed of two parts:
- **Anchor Member**: The initial query that seeds the recursion.
- **Recursive Member**: The recursive query that references the CTE itself.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
  -- Anchor Member
  SELECT ...
  FROM ...
  WHERE ...

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive Member
  SELECT ...
  FROM cte_name
  JOIN ...
  ON ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

### Anchor Member

The anchor member provides the starting point for the recursion. It defines the initial result set.

### Recursive Member

The recursive member is repeatedly executed, using the results of the previous iteration. It must include a termination condition to prevent infinite loops.

### Termination Condition

The recursion stops when the recursive member returns no new rows.

## 3. Hierarchical Data Processing using Recursive Queries

Hierarchical data structures, such as organizational charts, directory structures, and product hierarchies, can be effectively processed using recursive queries. In Oracle SQL, these structures are often navigated using hierarchical query clauses like `CONNECT BY`. Here, we explore how to replicate these capabilities using recursive CTEs.

### Key Concepts and Their Equivalents

1. **LEVEL Equivalent**: The recursion depth or level can be tracked by incrementing a column value in the recursive part of the query.

    **Example 1: Employee Levels**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE emp_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT employee_id, manager_id, 1 AS level
      FROM employees
      WHERE manager_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
      FROM employees e
      JOIN emp_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM emp_hierarchy;
    ```

    **Example 2: Directory Depth**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE dir_tree AS (
      SELECT directory_id, parent_id, 1 AS level
      FROM directories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT d.directory_id, d.parent_id, t.level + 1
      FROM directories d
      JOIN dir_tree t ON d.parent_id = t.directory_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM dir_tree;
    ```

2. **CONNECT_BY_ROOT Equivalent**: This can be emulated by selecting the root value in the anchor member and carrying it down through the recursive member.

    **Example 1: Root Employee**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE emp_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT employee_id, manager_id, employee_id AS root_id
      FROM employees
      WHERE manager_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, h.root_id
      FROM employees e
      JOIN emp_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM emp_hierarchy;
    ```

    **Example 2: Root Directory**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE dir_tree AS (
      SELECT directory_id, parent_id, directory_id AS root_id
      FROM directories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT d.directory_id, d.parent_id, t.root_id
      FROM directories d
      JOIN dir_tree t ON d.parent_id = t.directory_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM dir_tree;
    ```

3. **SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH Equivalent**: The path from the root to the current node can be constructed by concatenating values through the recursive process.

    **Example 1: Employee Path**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE emp_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT employee_id, manager_id, employee_name, CAST(employee_name AS VARCHAR2(1000)) AS path
      FROM employees
      WHERE manager_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.employee_name, h.path || '->' || e.employee_name
      FROM employees e
      JOIN emp_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM emp_hierarchy;
    ```

    **Example 2: Directory Path**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE dir_tree AS (
      SELECT directory_id, parent_id, directory_name, CAST(directory_name AS VARCHAR2(1000)) AS path
      FROM directories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT d.directory_id, d.parent_id, d.directory_name, t.path || '/' || d.directory_name
      FROM directories d
      JOIN dir_tree t ON d.parent_id = t.directory_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM dir_tree;
    ```

4. **CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF Equivalent**: Determining if a node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children) can be done by checking if the node appears as a parent in any other row.

    **Example 1: Employee Leaf Check**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE emp_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT employee_id, manager_id
      FROM employees
      WHERE manager_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id
      FROM employees e
      JOIN emp_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
    )
    SELECT e.*, 
           CASE WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE manager_id = e.employee_id) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_leaf
    FROM emp_hierarchy e;
    ```

    **Example 2: Directory Leaf Check**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE dir_tree AS (
      SELECT directory_id, parent_id
      FROM directories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT d.directory_id, d.parent_id
      FROM directories d
      JOIN dir_tree t ON d.parent_id = t.directory_id
    )
    SELECT d.*, 
           CASE WHEN NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM directories WHERE parent_id = d.directory_id) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_leaf
    FROM dir_tree d;
    ```

5. **NOCYCLE Equivalent**: Preventing infinite loops due to cycles can be managed by checking whether a node has already appeared in the path.

    **Example 1: Preventing Employee Cycle**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE emp_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT employee_id, manager_id, CAST(employee_id AS VARCHAR2(1000)) AS path
      FROM employees
      WHERE manager_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, h.path || '->' || e.employee_id
      FROM employees e
      JOIN emp_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
      WHERE INSTR(h.path, e.employee_id) = 0
    )
    SELECT * FROM emp_hierarchy;
    ```

    **Example 2: Preventing Directory Cycle**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE dir_tree AS (
      SELECT directory_id, parent_id, CAST(directory_id AS VARCHAR2(1000)) AS path
      FROM directories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT d.directory_id, d.parent_id, t.path || '->' || d.directory_id
      FROM directories d
      JOIN dir_tree t ON d.parent_id = t.directory_id


      WHERE INSTR(t.path, d.directory_id) = 0
    )
    SELECT * FROM dir_tree;
    ```

6. **CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE Equivalent**: This can be detected by checking if a node reappears in its own path.

    **Example 1: Detecting Employee Cycle**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE emp_hierarchy AS (
      SELECT employee_id, manager_id, CAST(employee_id AS VARCHAR2(1000)) AS path
      FROM employees
      WHERE manager_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, h.path || '->' || e.employee_id
      FROM employees e
      JOIN emp_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
    )
    SELECT *, 
           CASE WHEN INSTR(path, CAST(employee_id AS VARCHAR2(1000))) > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_cycle
    FROM emp_hierarchy;
    ```

    **Example 2: Detecting Directory Cycle**
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE dir_tree AS (
      SELECT directory_id, parent_id, CAST(directory_id AS VARCHAR2(1000)) AS path
      FROM directories
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT d.directory_id, d.parent_id, t.path || '->' || d.directory_id
      FROM directories d
      JOIN dir_tree t ON d.parent_id = t.directory_id
    )
    SELECT *, 
           CASE WHEN INSTR(path, CAST(directory_id AS VARCHAR2(1000))) > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_cycle
    FROM dir_tree;
    ```

# 7. Views

In Oracle SQL, a **view** is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query. Views provide a way to simplify complex queries, encapsulate data, and enhance security by restricting access to specific columns or rows of data.

## 1. What is a View?

A view is essentially a saved query that can be treated as a table in other SQL queries. It does not store data itself but retrieves data from underlying tables when queried.

### Benefits of Using Views

- **Simplification**: Views can simplify complex queries by encapsulating them into a single virtual table.
- **Security**: Views can restrict user access to sensitive data by exposing only specific columns or rows.
- **Data Abstraction**: Views provide a layer of abstraction over the database schema, which can help maintain application code if underlying tables change.

## 2. Creating a View

To create a view, you use the `CREATE VIEW` statement, followed by a `SELECT` statement that defines the data the view will represent.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_salaries AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 5000;
```

## 3. Querying a View

Once created, you can query a view just like a regular table.

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_salaries;
```

## 4. Updating Data Through a View

You can update, insert, and delete data through a view if the view is updatable. A view is updatable if it meets certain criteria, such as being based on a single table and not containing complex operations like joins or aggregations.

### Updating Example

```sql
UPDATE employee_salaries
SET salary = salary + 500
WHERE first_name = 'John';
```

### Inserting Example

```sql
INSERT INTO employee_salaries (first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe', 6000);
```

### Deleting Example

```sql
DELETE FROM employee_salaries
WHERE first_name = 'John';
```

## 5. Dropping a View

To remove a view, use the `DROP VIEW` statement.

### Syntax

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

### Example

```sql
DROP VIEW employee_salaries;
```

## 6. Updatable Views

Not all views are updatable. To be updatable, a view must adhere to specific rules, such as:

- The view must be based on a single table.
- The view must not contain `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, or `DISTINCT` clauses.
- The view must include all columns required by the base table's primary key.

## 7. Materialized Views

A **materialized view** is a database object that contains the results of a query. Unlike a regular view, which dynamically retrieves data from the underlying tables, a materialized view stores the query result physically and can be refreshed periodically. This makes materialized views useful for improving query performance and reducing the load on database systems.

### 1. What is a Materialized View?

A materialized view is essentially a snapshot of the result of a query at a specific point in time. It can be queried just like a table and is particularly useful for aggregating and summarizing large datasets.

#### Benefits of Materialized Views

- **Improved Performance**: Since data is precomputed and stored, querying a materialized view can be faster compared to executing complex queries repeatedly.
- **Reduced Load**: Offloads computation and reduces the load on the underlying tables, which can be beneficial for large datasets.
- **Snapshot Consistency**: Provides a consistent snapshot of data at the time of the view's last refresh.

### 2. Creating a Materialized View

To create a materialized view, use the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name
[BUILD IMMEDIATE | BUILD DEFERRED]
[REFRESH [FAST | COMPLETE | FORCE] [START WITH date] [NEXT date]]
AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Parameters

- **BUILD IMMEDIATE**: Populates the materialized view immediately upon creation.
- **BUILD DEFERRED**: Delays population until the materialized view is refreshed for the first time.
- **REFRESH FAST**: Updates the materialized view using incremental changes (requires materialized view logs).
- **REFRESH COMPLETE**: Rebuilds the materialized view from scratch.
- **START WITH**: Specifies when the materialized view should be first refreshed.
- **NEXT**: Specifies the interval for subsequent refreshes.

#### Example

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH COMPLETE
START WITH SYSDATE
NEXT SYSDATE + 1
AS
SELECT department_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### 3. Refreshing a Materialized View

Materialized views can be refreshed automatically according to a defined schedule or manually.

#### Automatic Refresh

You can set up automatic refreshes using the `START WITH` and `NEXT` clauses in the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

#### Manual Refresh

To manually refresh a materialized view, use the `DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH` procedure.

##### Example

```sql
BEGIN
    DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('sales_summary');
END;
```

#### Refresh Options

- **FAST**: Uses materialized view logs to apply only the changes made since the last refresh.
- **COMPLETE**: Rebuilds the materialized view from scratch.
- **FORCE**: Chooses between FAST or COMPLETE refresh based on the availability of materialized view logs.

### 4. Querying a Materialized View

You can query a materialized view just like a regular table.

#### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
```

### 5. Managing Materialized Views

#### Dropping a Materialized View

To remove a materialized view, use the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

##### Example

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

#### Indexes on Materialized Views

You can create indexes on materialized views to improve query performance.

##### Example

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_summary ON sales_summary(department_id);
```

#### Materialized View Logs

To use fast refresh, you need to create materialized view logs on the base tables.

##### Example

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON sales
WITH ROWID
(PARTITION_ID, SALES_AMOUNT);
```

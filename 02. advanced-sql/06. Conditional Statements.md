# 6. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in Oracle SQL are used to control the flow of data and to perform different operations based on specific conditions. They are essential for making decisions within SQL queries and are typically implemented using `CASE`, `DECODE`, and various conditional functions.

## 1. CASE Statement

The `CASE` statement provides a way to handle conditional logic in SQL queries. There are two types of `CASE` statements:

### 1.1. Simple CASE Statement

The simple `CASE` statement compares an expression to a set of values and returns a result based on the first match.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CASE department_id
        WHEN 10 THEN 'Administration'
        WHEN 20 THEN 'Marketing'
        WHEN 30 THEN 'Sales'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS department_name
FROM employees;
```

### 1.2. Searched CASE Statement

The searched `CASE` statement evaluates a set of Boolean expressions and returns the result of the first true condition.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 5000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN salary > 10000 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Undefined'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
```

## 2. DECODE Function

The `DECODE` function is Oracle's proprietary function for conditional logic, similar to `CASE`. It compares an expression to a set of values and returns the corresponding result.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    DECODE(department_id,
        10, 'Administration',
        20, 'Marketing',
        30, 'Sales',
        'Other') AS department_name
FROM employees;
```

## 3. Conditional Functions

Oracle SQL provides several built-in functions that offer conditional logic capabilities.

### 3.1. NVL Function

The `NVL` function replaces `NULL` values with a specified value.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    NVL(commission_pct, 0) AS commission_pct
FROM employees;
```

### 3.2. COALESCE Function

The `COALESCE` function returns the first non-null expression among its arguments.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    COALESCE(commission_pct, bonus, 0) AS compensation
FROM employees;
```

### 3.3. NULLIF Function

The `NULLIF` function returns `NULL` if the two expressions are equal; otherwise, it returns the first expression.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    NULLIF(salary, 0) AS adjusted_salary
FROM employees;
```

### 3.4. CASE in ORDER BY

The `CASE` statement can also be used in the `ORDER BY` clause to control sorting based on conditions.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 5000 THEN 1
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 2
        WHEN salary > 10000 THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END;
```

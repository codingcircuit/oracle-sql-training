# 3 Subqueries

Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are queries embedded within other queries. They allow you to perform complex data retrieval and manipulation by breaking down a problem into simpler components. Subqueries can be used in various SQL clauses and provide powerful ways to interact with data.

## 1. Basic Subquery

A basic subquery is used in the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements. It typically returns a single value or a set of values.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```
This example retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department by using a subquery to find the department ID.

## 2. Subqueries in `WHERE` Clause

Subqueries in the `WHERE` clause allow you to filter results based on conditions specified in another query.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1400);
```
This example retrieves employees working in departments located in a specific location.

## 3. Subqueries in `FROM` Clause

Subqueries in the `FROM` clause are used to create a derived table that can be queried as if it were a regular table.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 WHERE condition) alias_name;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM (SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees WHERE hire_date > '01-JAN-2015')
GROUP BY department_id;
```
This example creates a derived table of employees hired after January 1, 2015, and calculates the average salary per department.

## 4. Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query and is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1 t1
WHERE column1 > (SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table2 t2 WHERE t2.column2 = t1.column2);
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
```
This example retrieves employees whose salary is above the average salary of their respective departments.

## 5. Subqueries with `EXISTS` Clause

The `EXISTS` clause is used with subqueries to test for the existence of rows that satisfy the subquery condition.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT department_id, department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.salary > 5000);
```
This example retrieves departments that have employees with a salary greater than 5000.

## 6. Subqueries with `ANY` and `ALL` Operators

The `ANY` and `ALL` operators are used to compare a value to any or all values returned by a subquery.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column1 > ANY (SELECT column1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);

SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column1 > ALL (SELECT column1 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 60);

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 60);
```
In the first query, it retrieves employees whose salary is greater than any salary in department 60, while the second query retrieves those with a salary greater than all salaries in department 60.

## 7. Subqueries in `SELECT` Clause

Subqueries can be used in the `SELECT` clause to compute values dynamically.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1,
       (SELECT aggregate_function(column2) FROM table2 WHERE condition) AS alias_name
FROM table1;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT department_id, 
       (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id) AS max_salary
FROM departments d;
```
This example retrieves each department along with the maximum salary in that department.

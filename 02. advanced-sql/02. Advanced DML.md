# 2. Advanced DML

Advanced Data Manipulation Language (DML) techniques in Oracle SQL enhance your ability to manage and manipulate data efficiently. These techniques go beyond basic `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, providing more sophisticated ways to handle data.

## 1. `MERGE` Statement

The `MERGE` statement, also known as an "upsert," allows you to perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations in a single statement based on the conditions.

### Syntax
```sql
MERGE INTO target_table t
USING source_table s
ON (t.join_condition = s.join_condition)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET t.column1 = s.column1, t.column2 = s.column2
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (column1, column2)
    VALUES (s.column1, s.column2);
```

### Example
```sql
MERGE INTO employees e
USING new_employees ne
ON (e.employee_id = ne.employee_id)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET e.salary = ne.salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary)
    VALUES (ne.employee_id, ne.first_name, ne.last_name, ne.salary);
```
This example updates the salary of existing employees and inserts new employees if they don't already exist.

## 2. `RETURNING INTO` Clause

The `RETURNING INTO` clause allows you to return values from `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations directly into PL/SQL variables.

### Syntax
```sql
DML_STATEMENT
RETURNING column1, column2 INTO :variable1, :variable2;
```

### Example
```sql
DECLARE
    v_emp_id employees.employee_id%TYPE;
    v_salary employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, salary)
    VALUES (101, 'John Doe', 5000)
    RETURNING employee_id, salary INTO v_emp_id, v_salary;
    
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Inserted Employee ID: ' || v_emp_id);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary: ' || v_salary);
END;
```
This example inserts a new employee and retrieves the employee ID and salary into PL/SQL variables.

## 3. `UPDATE` with Subqueries

You can use subqueries in the `UPDATE` statement to modify rows based on results from other queries.

### Syntax
```sql
UPDATE target_table t
SET t.column1 = (SELECT value FROM source_table s WHERE condition)
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM source_table s WHERE condition);
```

### Example
```sql
UPDATE employees e
SET e.salary = (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id)
WHERE department_id IS NOT NULL;
```
This example updates each employee's salary to the average salary of their department.

## 4. `INSERT ALL` and `INSERT FIRST`

These statements allow you to perform multiple `INSERT` operations in a single statement based on certain conditions.

### Syntax for `INSERT ALL`
```sql
INSERT ALL
    INTO table1 (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)
    INTO table2 (column1, column2) VALUES (value3, value4)
SELECT * FROM dual;
```

### Syntax for `INSERT FIRST`
```sql
INSERT FIRST
    WHEN condition1 THEN INTO table1 (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)
    WHEN condition2 THEN INTO table2 (column1, column2) VALUES (value3, value4)
SELECT * FROM dual;
```

### Example
```sql
INSERT ALL
    WHEN salary < 5000 THEN INTO low_salary_employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (employee_id, salary)
    WHEN salary >= 5000 THEN INTO high_salary_employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (employee_id, salary)
SELECT employee_id, salary FROM employees;
```
This example inserts rows into different tables based on the salary value.

## 5. `DELETE` with `JOIN`

Oracle SQL does not support direct `DELETE` with `JOIN`, but you can achieve similar results using correlated subqueries.

### Syntax
```sql
DELETE FROM target_table
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM join_table WHERE join_condition);
```

### Example
```sql
DELETE FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id AND d.location_id = 1400);
```
This example deletes employees who belong to departments located in a specific location.

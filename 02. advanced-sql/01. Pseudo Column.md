# 1. Pseudo Column

In Oracle SQL, **pseudo columns** are special columns that can be used in SQL queries just like regular columns but are not physically stored in the database tables. They are generated dynamically by the Oracle Database and provide useful information or perform specific functions related to query results or table data.

## Index

1. [ROWNUM](#rownum)
2. [ROWID](#rowid)
3. [SYSDATE](#sysdate)
4. [CURRVAL and NEXTVAL](#currval-and-nextval)
5. [LEVEL](#level)
6. [DECODE](#decode)

## Common Pseudo Columns

### 1. `ROWNUM`

- **Description**: Returns a unique number for each row in the result set, starting from 1. The number is assigned to rows before the `ORDER BY` clause is applied.
- **Usage**: Often used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```
This query retrieves the first 5 rows from the `employees` table.

### 2. `ROWID`

- **Description**: Provides the unique address (location) of a row in a table. It is useful for identifying and locating rows quickly.
- **Usage**: Can be used to quickly access and manipulate specific rows.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT ROWID, employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```
This query retrieves the `ROWID` along with `employee_id` and `first_name` for the employee with ID 101.

### 3. `SYSDATE`

- **Description**: Returns the current date and time from the system clock of the database server.
- **Usage**: Often used to insert or compare date and time values.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT employee_id, hire_date, SYSDATE
FROM employees;
```
This query retrieves the `employee_id`, `hire_date`, and the current system date and time.

### 4. `CURRVAL and NEXTVAL`

- **Description**: These pseudo columns are used with sequences. `CURRVAL` returns the current value of a sequence, while `NEXTVAL` generates the next value in the sequence.
- **Usage**: Useful for generating unique values, typically for primary keys.

#### Example
```sql
-- Assuming a sequence named emp_seq
SELECT emp_seq.CURRVAL AS current_value
FROM dual;

SELECT emp_seq.NEXTVAL AS next_value
FROM dual;
```
These queries retrieve the current and next values from a sequence named `emp_seq`.

### 5. `LEVEL`

- **Description**: Provides the level of a node in a hierarchical query using the `CONNECT BY` clause. The top level has a value of 1.
- **Usage**: Useful for querying hierarchical data structures.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT LEVEL, employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
START WITH manager_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
```
This query displays employees in a hierarchical order starting from the top-most manager.

### 6. `DECODE`

- **Description**: Functions as a conditional expression similar to an `IF-THEN-ELSE` construct. Returns a value based on the comparison of an expression.
- **Usage**: Useful for performing conditional logic in SQL queries.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT employee_id, DECODE(job_id, 'IT_PROG', 'IT Programmer', 'Other') AS job_description
FROM employees;
```
This query returns 'IT Programmer' if the `job_id` is 'IT_PROG', otherwise returns 'Other'.

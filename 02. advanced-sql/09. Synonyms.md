# 9. Synonyms

In Oracle SQL, a **synonym** is an alias or alternative name for a database object, such as a table, view, sequence, or other database objects. Synonyms provide a way to simplify access to these objects and can be useful for hiding the complexity of the underlying database schema.

## 1. What is a Synonym?

A synonym allows you to reference a database object using a different name. This can be particularly helpful in scenarios where you want to:

- **Simplify Queries**: Use shorter or more meaningful names.
- **Enhance Security**: Hide the actual object names or their schema.
- **Support Schema Changes**: Reference an object without needing to change existing queries or application code.

## 2. Types of Synonyms

### 2.1 Public Synonyms

- **Definition**: Accessible to all users in the database.
- **Usage**: Generally used for common objects that need to be accessed by multiple users or applications.

### 2.2 Private Synonyms

- **Definition**: Accessible only to the user who created it.
- **Usage**: Used to simplify access to objects owned by the user.

## 3. Creating a Synonym

To create a synonym, use the `CREATE SYNONYM` statement. You can create both public and private synonyms.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE [PUBLIC] SYNONYM synonym_name FOR schema.object_name;
```

### Parameters

- **PUBLIC**: Optional keyword that specifies a public synonym.
- **synonym_name**: The name of the synonym you want to create.
- **schema.object_name**: The actual name of the object that the synonym points to.

### Example: Creating a Private Synonym

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM emp_syn FOR hr.employees;
```

In this example, `emp_syn` is a private synonym for the `employees` table in the `hr` schema.

### Example: Creating a Public Synonym

```sql
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_syn FOR hr.employees;
```

In this example, `emp_syn` is a public synonym for the `employees` table in the `hr` schema, making it accessible to all users.

## 4. Using a Synonym

Once a synonym is created, you can use it in SQL queries just like you would use the original object name.

### Example

```sql
-- Query using the synonym
SELECT * FROM emp_syn;

-- Insert using the synonym
INSERT INTO emp_syn (employee_id, first_name, last_name) 
VALUES (1001, 'Jane', 'Doe');
```

In these examples, `emp_syn` is used instead of `hr.employees`.

## 5. Dropping a Synonym

To remove a synonym, use the `DROP SYNONYM` statement. You can drop both public and private synonyms.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
DROP [PUBLIC] SYNONYM synonym_name;
```

### Example: Dropping a Private Synonym

```sql
DROP SYNONYM emp_syn;
```

### Example: Dropping a Public Synonym

```sql
DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_syn;
```

## 6. Synonym Examples

### Example 1: Simplifying Access

Imagine you have a long table name or a table in another schema that you frequently access. Creating a synonym can make your queries simpler.

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM short_name FOR long_schema_name.really_long_table_name;
```

Now you can use `short_name` in your queries instead of the full table name.

### Example 2: Enhancing Security

You might want to hide the schema or object details from end-users. For instance, if you want to hide the schema name:

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM customer_data FOR sales.customers;
```

Users can now access the `customers` table without knowing it is in the `sales` schema.

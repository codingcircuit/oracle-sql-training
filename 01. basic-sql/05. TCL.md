## Overview

Oracle server uses transactions to ensure data consistency. A transaction is a set of one or more DML statements that Oracle treats as a single logical unit of work. Transactions group SQL statements so that they are either all committed (applied to the database) or rolled back (undone from the database). Changes made by DML statements become permanent and visible to other users only after committing. DCL and DDL commands automatically force a commit, and explicit committing is not required.

---

## Transaction Start and End Scenarios

A transaction begins when the first executable SQL statement is encountered. It ends when any of the following actions occur:
- A COMMIT or ROLLBACK is issued.
- A DDL statement is issued.
- A DCL statement is issued.
- A normal shutdown of the database.
- Machine or system failure.

## Explicit Transaction Control Statements

### COMMIT

The COMMIT statement ends the current transaction by making all pending data changes permanent. Once committed, all users can view the recent changes.

```sql
COMMIT;
```

#### Example
```sql
DROP TABLE department;

CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4), 
      department_name  VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT dept_name_nn1 NOT NULL,
      manager_id       NUMBER(6),
      location_id      NUMBER(4),
      CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    );

INSERT INTO department VALUES (20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);
INSERT INTO department VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);

COMMIT;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department;
```

### SAVEPOINT

A SAVEPOINT marks a point in the current transaction to which you can later roll back. Multiple savepoints can be created within a single transaction.

```sql
SAVEPOINT <NAME>;
```

#### Example
```sql
DROP TABLE department;

CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4), 
      department_name  VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT dept_name_nn1 NOT NULL,
      manager_id       NUMBER(6),
      location_id      NUMBER(4),
      CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    );

INSERT INTO department VALUES (20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);

SAVEPOINT firstrow;

INSERT INTO department VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);

ROLLBACK TO firstrow;

COMMIT;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department;
```

### ROLLBACK

The ROLLBACK statement ends the current transaction by discarding all pending data changes. It undoes the changes and restores the database to the last commit point. Locks on the affected rows are automatically released.

```sql
ROLLBACK;

ROLLBACK TO <SAVEPOINT NAME>;
```

#### Example
```sql
DROP TABLE department;

CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4), 
      department_name  VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT dept_name_nn1 NOT NULL,
      manager_id       NUMBER(6),
      location_id      NUMBER(4),
      CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    );

INSERT INTO department VALUES (20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);
INSERT INTO department VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);

ROLLBACK;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department;
```

> **Note:** No records are inserted into the table due to the ROLLBACK command.

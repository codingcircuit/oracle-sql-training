# 9.Joins

In Oracle SQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins allow you to retrieve and analyze data that spans multiple tables.

## Types of Joins

### 1. Inner Join

An **Inner Join** returns rows when there is a match in both tables. It is the most common type of join.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

#### Example

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 2. Left Join (or Left Outer Join)

A **Left Join** returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

#### Example

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 3. Right Join (or Right Outer Join)

A **Right Join** returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

#### Example

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 4. Full Join (or Full Outer Join)

A **Full Join** returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table that lacks a match.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

#### Example

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 5. Cross Join

A **Cross Join** returns the Cartesian product of the two tables involved. Each row of the first table is combined with each row of the second table.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

#### Example

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, d.department_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
```

### 6. Self Join

A **Self Join** is a regular join but the table is joined with itself. This is useful for hierarchical data.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name
FROM table a
INNER JOIN table b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

#### Example

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id, e1.first_name, e2.first_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e1
INNER JOIN employees e2
ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

## Overview

Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a structured query language used for inserting, updating, and deleting data in database objects like tables or views. DML statements modify the stored data but not the database object structure.

Commonly used DML statements are:
- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table.

## INSERT

### Inserting Using Column List

Below is the script to create Employees and Departments tables (**HR Schema**) along with constraints (**inline specification**).

```sql
DROP TABLE department;
DROP TABLE department_copy;

CREATE TABLE department
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4), 
      department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn1  NOT NULL,
      manager_id       NUMBER(6),
      location_id      NUMBER(4),
      CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk1 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    );

CREATE TABLE department_copy
    ( department_id    NUMBER(4), 
      department_name  VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT  dept_name_nn2  NOT NULL,
      manager_id       NUMBER(6),
      location_id      NUMBER(4),
      CONSTRAINT dept_id_pk2 PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
    );

INSERT INTO department (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME, MANAGER_ID, LOCATION_ID)  
VALUES (10, 'Administration', 200, 1700);
```

### Inserting Without Column List

The data should be inserted in the order of columns for all the columns.

```sql
INSERT INTO department 
VALUES (20, 'Marketing', 201, 1800);
```

### Inserting Interactively

```sql
INSERT INTO department VALUES (&DEPARTMENT_ID, '&DEPARTMENT_NAME', &MANAGER_ID, &LOCATION_ID);
```

> **Note:** When the SQL for inserting records interactively is executed, you will be prompted to enter the values for arguments.  
> Example values:
> - DEPARTMENT_ID: 30
> - DEPARTMENT_NAME: Purchasing
> - MANAGER_ID: 114
> - LOCATION_ID: 1700

```sql
INSERT INTO department VALUES (30, 'Purchasing', 114, 1700);
```

### Copying Data from One Table to Another

```sql
INSERT INTO department_copy 
SELECT * FROM department;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department_copy;
```

## UPDATE

The UPDATE command is used to change or modify one or more record data in a table.

### Updating with WHERE Clause

- First, the records that satisfy the condition are filtered.
- Then, only those records are updated.

```sql
UPDATE department
SET DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'Single Row Update'
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 10;
```

### Updating Without WHERE Clause

All rows will be updated if no condition is specified in the WHERE clause.

```sql
UPDATE department_copy
SET DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'All Rows Update';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department;
```

![images/update-table-data-with-where.png](/01.%20basic-sql/images/update-table-data-with-where.png?raw=true)

```sql
SELECT * FROM department_copy;
```

![images/update-table-data-without-where.png](/01.%20basic-sql/images/update-table-data-without-where.png?raw=true)

---

## DELETE

The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.

### Deleting with WHERE Clause

A subset may be defined for deletion using the WHERE condition.

```sql
DELETE FROM department
WHERE DEPARTMENT_NAME = 'Single Row Update';
```

### Deleting Without WHERE Clause

If no WHERE condition is specified, all records will be removed.

```sql
DELETE FROM department_copy;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM department;
```

![images/delete-table-data-with-where.png](/01.%20basic-sql/images/delete-table-data-with-where.png?raw=true)

```sql
SELECT * FROM department_copy;
```

![images/delete-table-data-without-where.png](/01.%20basic-sql/images/delete-table-data-without-where.png?raw=true)

> **Note:** Without a WHERE condition, all records in the table will be deleted.

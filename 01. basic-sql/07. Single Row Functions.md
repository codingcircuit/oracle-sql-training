SELECT COALESCE(commission_pct, 0) AS commission FROM employees;
SELECT COALESCE(DISCOUNT, 'No Discount') AS discount_description FROM sales;
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, SYSDATE) AS date_or_now FROM dual;

### `DECODE`
Provides conditional logic similar to a case statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECODE(expression, search1, result1 [, search2, result2, ...] [, default])
```

**Examples:**
```sql
SELECT DECODE(1, 1, 'One', 2, 'Two', 'Other') AS result FROM dual;
SELECT DECODE(SALARY, 50000, 'Standard', 60000, 'High', 'Other') AS salary_category FROM employees;
SELECT DECODE(commission_pct, NULL, 'No Commission', commission_pct, 'Commission') AS commission_status FROM employees;
SELECT DECODE(MONTH(SYSDATE), 1, 'January', 2, 'February', 'Other') AS month_name FROM dual;
SELECT DECODE(SUM(SALES_AMOUNT), NULL, 'No Sales', 'Sales Recorded') AS sales_status FROM sales;
SELECT DECODE(DAYOFWEEK(SYSDATE), 1, 'Sunday', 2, 'Monday', 'Weekday') AS day_description FROM dual;
SELECT DECODE(CATEGORY, 'A', 'Category A', 'B', 'Category B', 'Other') AS category_description FROM products;
SELECT DECODE(SUM(SALES_AMOUNT), 0, 'No Sales', 'Sales Present') AS sales_status FROM sales;
SELECT DECODE(SYSDATE, SYSDATE, 'Today', 'Not Today') AS date_check FROM dual;
SELECT DECODE(SALARY, 50000, 'Standard Salary', 60000, 'High Salary', 'Other') AS salary_status FROM employees;
```

### `CASE`
Provides conditional logic similar to DECODE but with more flexibility.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
```

**Examples:**
```sql
SELECT CASE
           WHEN SYSDATE < DATE '2024-01-01' THEN 'Before 2024'
           WHEN SYSDATE = DATE '2024-01-01' THEN 'New Year'
           ELSE 'After 2024'
       END AS date_status
FROM dual;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN SALARY > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
           WHEN SALARY BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
           ELSE 'Low Salary'
       END AS salary_category
FROM employees;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN commission_pct IS NULL THEN 'No Commission'
           ELSE 'Commission Present'
       END AS commission_status
FROM employees;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN MONTH(SYSDATE) = 1 THEN 'January'
           WHEN MONTH(SYSDATE) = 2 THEN 'February'
           ELSE 'Other Month'
       END AS month_name
FROM dual;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN SUM(SALES_AMOUNT) IS NULL THEN 'No Sales'
           ELSE 'Sales Recorded'
       END AS sales_status
FROM sales;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN DAYOFWEEK(SYSDATE) = 1 THEN 'Sunday'
           WHEN DAYOFWEEK(SYSDATE) = 2 THEN 'Monday'
           ELSE 'Weekday'
       END AS day_description
FROM dual;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN CATEGORY = 'A' THEN 'Category A'
           WHEN CATEGORY = 'B' THEN 'Category B'
           ELSE 'Other'
       END AS category_description
FROM products;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN SUM(SALES_AMOUNT) = 0 THEN 'No Sales'
           ELSE 'Sales Present'
       END AS sales_status
FROM sales;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN SYSDATE = SYSDATE THEN 'Today'
           ELSE 'Not Today'
       END AS date_check
FROM dual;

SELECT CASE
           WHEN SALARY = 50000 THEN 'Standard Salary'
           WHEN SALARY = 60000 THEN 'High Salary'
           ELSE 'Other'
       END AS salary_status
FROM employees;

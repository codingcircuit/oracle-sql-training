## 1. Database Management System (DBMS)

- A database is a collection of related data organized in a way that data can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
- DBMS was created to overcome the limitations of the traditional file processing system.
- A general-purpose Database Management System (DBMS) is software intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data.
- Examples of database management systems include:
  - MySQL
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - MS Foxpro
  - SQLite
  - FileMaker Pro
- The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a convenient and efficient way to store and retrieve database information.
- Relational DBMS (RDBMS) is the most commonly used type of DBMS.

## 2. Relational Database Management System

- In the relational model, data is stored in database objects called **tables**.
- A table is a collection of related data entities consisting of rows and columns.
- A **tuple**, also known as a **row**, represents an individual entry or record in a table.
- Tables are organized into smaller entities called **fields**. A field is a **column** that maintains specific information about every record in the table.
- A column is a vertical entity in a table containing all information associated with a specific field.

## 3. Structured Query Language

- Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard querying language for organizing, managing, and retrieving data stored in relational databases. SQL is pronounced as 'sequel' and was previously known as 'Structured English Query Language'.

### Key SQL Functions
- **Querying Data**: Retrieve data from tables.
- **Data Manipulation**: Insert, update, and delete rows in a table.
- **Data Definition**: Create, replace, alter, and drop database objects.
- **Access Control**: Control access to the database and its objects.
- **Consistency and Integrity**: Ensure database consistency and integrity.

### SQL Categories
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
- **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**
- **Data Query Language (DQL)** or **Data Retrieval Language (DRL)** (SELECT statements, often referred to as DML statements)

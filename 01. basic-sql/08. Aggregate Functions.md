# 08.Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions in Oracle SQL perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. These functions are commonly used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate data for analysis and reporting. This document provides an overview of the primary aggregate functions available in Oracle SQL.

## 1. `COUNT`

Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values in a column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
COUNT([DISTINCT | ALL] expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Count the total number of rows in a table
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM employees;

-- Count the number of non-NULL values in a column
SELECT COUNT(salary) AS salary_count FROM employees;
```

## 2. `SUM`

Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SUM(expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Calculate the total salary expense
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;

-- Calculate the sum of distinct salaries
SELECT SUM(DISTINCT salary) AS distinct_salary_sum FROM employees;
```

## 3. `AVG`

Calculates the average value of a numeric column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
AVG(expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Calculate the average salary
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;

-- Calculate the average salary for a specific department
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

## 4. `MIN`

Returns the minimum value of a column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
MIN(expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Find the lowest salary
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary FROM employees;

-- Find the minimum salary in each department
SELECT department_id, MIN(salary) AS min_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

## 5. `MAX`

Returns the maximum value of a column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
MAX(expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Find the highest salary
SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees;

-- Find the maximum salary in each department
SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

## 6. `LISTAGG`

Aggregates multiple rows into a single string with a specified delimiter.

**Syntax:**
```sql
LISTAGG(expression, delimiter) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Concatenate employee names with a comma separator
SELECT LISTAGG(employee_name, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY employee_name) AS employee_names
FROM employees;

-- Concatenate employee names for each department
SELECT department_id,
       LISTAGG(employee_name, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY employee_name) AS employee_names
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

## 7. `GROUP_CONCAT` (Available in other SQL databases like MySQL)

Oracle SQL does not have a `GROUP_CONCAT` function, but `LISTAGG` is its equivalent in functionality.

## 8. `STDDEV` and `VARIANCE`

Calculate the standard deviation and variance of numeric values.

**Syntax for `STDDEV`:**
```sql
STDDEV(expression)
```

**Syntax for `VARIANCE`:**
```sql
VARIANCE(expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Calculate the standard deviation of salaries
SELECT STDDEV(salary) AS salary_stddev FROM employees;

-- Calculate the variance of salaries
SELECT VARIANCE(salary) AS salary_variance FROM employees;
```

## 9. `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `PERCENTILE_DISC`

Calculate the percentile of a distribution.

**Syntax for `PERCENTILE_CONT`:**
```sql
PERCENTILE_CONT(percentile) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY expression)
```

**Syntax for `PERCENTILE_DISC`:**
```sql
PERCENTILE_DISC(percentile) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY expression)
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Calculate the 90th percentile of salaries
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) AS percentile_90
FROM employees;

-- Calculate the 50th percentile (median) of salaries
SELECT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) AS median_salary
FROM employees;
```

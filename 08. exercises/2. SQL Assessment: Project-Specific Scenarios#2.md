## SQL Assessment: Project-Specific Scenarios

### Background
This assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to work with Oracle SQL in a project-specific context. You will be working with tables related to employees, departments, and projects. Please ensure that you execute each DDL statement to create the required tables and insert the supporting data before attempting the exercises.

### Supporting Data

Save the following SQL script in a file named `supporting_data.sql` and execute it to set up the necessary tables and data:

```sql
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50),
    hire_date DATE,
    salary NUMBER,
    department_id NUMBER,
    manager_id NUMBER,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR2(50),
    location VARCHAR2(50)
);

CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR2(100),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    project_manager VARCHAR2(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employee_projects (
    employee_id NUMBER,
    project_id NUMBER,
    hours_worked NUMBER,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(project_id)
);

-- Insert data into departments table
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name, location)
VALUES (1, 'HR', 'New York');

INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name, location)
VALUES (2, 'Engineering', 'San Francisco');

INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name, location)
VALUES (3, 'Sales', 'Chicago');

-- Insert data into employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date, salary, department_id, manager_id)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', TO_DATE('2020-01-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 70000, 2, NULL);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date, salary, department_id, manager_id)
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', TO_DATE('2021-03-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 80000, 2, 1);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date, salary, department_id, manager_id)
VALUES (3, 'Alice', 'Johnson', TO_DATE('2019-05-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 60000, 3, 1);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date, salary, department_id, manager_id)
VALUES (4, 'Bob', 'Brown', TO_DATE('2022-07-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 50000, 1, NULL);

-- Insert data into projects table
INSERT INTO projects (project_id, project_name, start_date, end_date, project_manager)
VALUES (101, 'Project Alpha', TO_DATE('2023-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2023-12-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Jane Smith');

INSERT INTO projects (project_id, project_name, start_date, end_date, project_manager)
VALUES (102, 'Project Beta', TO_DATE('2023-02-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2023-11-30', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Alice Johnson');

-- Insert data into employee_projects table
INSERT INTO employee_projects (employee_id, project_id, hours_worked)
VALUES (1, 101, 100);

INSERT INTO employee_projects (employee_id, project_id, hours_worked)
VALUES (2, 101, 150);

INSERT INTO employee_projects (employee_id, project_id, hours_worked)
VALUES (3, 102, 120);

INSERT INTO employee_projects (employee_id, project_id, hours_worked)
VALUES (4, 102, 80);
```

### Assessment Exercises

#### 2. List Employees and Their Departments
Write a query to list all employees along with their department names.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

#### 3. Calculate Total Hours Worked on Projects
Write a query to calculate the total hours worked by each employee across all projects.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, SUM(ep.hours_worked) AS total_hours
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.employee_id = ep.employee_id
GROUP BY e.first_name, e.last_name;
```

#### 4. Retrieve Employees with No Projects Assigned
Write a query to find all employees who are not assigned to any projects.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.employee_id = ep.employee_id
WHERE ep.project_id IS NULL;
```

#### 5. List Projects and Their Total Hours Worked

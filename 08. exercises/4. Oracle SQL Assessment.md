6. How do you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks?
7. Describe the importance of monitoring and maintaining database performance.
8. Explain how partitioning can improve query performance.
9. How do you use database tools to analyze performance metrics?
10. Provide an example of performance tuning for a complex query.

**Supporting Data:**

```sql
-- Example of using profiling tools (may vary by database)
SELECT * FROM v$sql WHERE parsing_schema_name = 'MY_USER';

-- Example of database tuning with caching
ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_CACHE_SIZE = 104857600; -- Set cache size to 100 MB

-- Example of connection tuning
ALTER SYSTEM SET SESSIONS = 300;

-- Example of performance tuning with partitioning
CREATE TABLE employees_partitioned (
    employee_id NUMBER,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    department_id NUMBER
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (department_id) (
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (20),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (30)
);
```

#### 03. Execution Plans
**Questions:**
1. What is an execution plan, and why is it important for SQL performance?
2. Explain how to generate and interpret an execution plan in Oracle SQL.
3. Describe the different types of operations you might see in an execution plan.
4. How can you use an execution plan to identify performance issues?
5. Provide an example of optimizing a query based on its execution plan.
6. What are some common indicators of inefficient queries in an execution plan?
7. How do you use hints in SQL to influence execution plans?
8. Explain the role of cost-based optimization in execution plans.
9. Describe how to review and optimize execution plans for complex queries.
10. How can you use execution plans to compare different query strategies?

**Supporting Data:**

```sql
-- Generate an execution plan
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;

-- View the execution plan
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);

-- Example of optimizing a query based on execution plan
SELECT first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;

-- Optimized query with index hint
SELECT /*+ INDEX(employees idx_dept_id) */ first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
```

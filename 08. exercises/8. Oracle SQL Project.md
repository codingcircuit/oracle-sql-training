## Oracle SQL Project: Comprehensive Guide

### 1. **Project Overview**

This project covers a wide range of Oracle SQL concepts, including basic queries, joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, single-row functions, set operations, and analytical functions. The sample database schema for the fictional company, XYZ Corp, is enhanced with more data to illustrate these concepts effectively.

### 2. **Database Schema**

#### 2.1 **Tables and Their Descriptions**

- **Employees**: Stores information about employees.
- **Departments**: Contains department details.
- **Projects**: Holds project information.
- **Employee_Projects**: Tracks employee assignments to projects.
- **Salaries**: Records historical salary data.
- **Tasks**: Details specific tasks within projects.

  ```

- **Select Employees in a Specific Department**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees
  WHERE DepartmentID = 2;
  ```

- **Select Projects and Their Start Dates**

  ```sql
  SELECT ProjectName, StartDate

  ```sql
  SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Left Join: Employees and Projects**

  ```sql
  SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, p.ProjectName
  FROM Employees e
  LEFT JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
  LEFT JOIN Projects p ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID;
  ```

- **Join with Additional Table: Projects and Tasks**

  ```sql
  SELECT p.ProjectName, t.TaskName, e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS AssignedTo
  FROM Projects p
  JOIN Tasks t ON p.ProjectID = t.ProjectID
  LEFT JOIN Employees e ON t.AssignedTo = e.EmployeeID;
  ```

#### 4.3 **Subqueries**

- **Find Employees with Salaries Above the Average**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees
  WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
  ```

- **Find Departments with More than 1 Employee**

  ```sql
  SELECT DepartmentID
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY DepartmentID
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

- **Find Projects with Tasks Assigned to Specific Employee**

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT p.ProjectName
  FROM Projects p
  JOIN Tasks t ON p.ProjectID = t.ProjectID
  WHERE t.AssignedTo = 101;
  ```

#### 4.4 **Aggregate Functions**

- **Total Salary by Department**

  ```sql
  SELECT d.DepartmentName, SUM(e.Salary) AS TotalSalary
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
  GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
  ```

- **Average Salary by Department**

  ```sql
  SELECT d.DepartmentName, AVG(e.Salary) AS AverageSalary
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
  GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
  ```

- **Count of Tasks per Project**

  ```sql
  SELECT p.ProjectName, COUNT(t.TaskID) AS TaskCount
  FROM Projects p
  LEFT JOIN Tasks t ON p.ProjectID = t.ProjectID
  GROUP BY p.ProjectName;
  ```

#### 4.5 **Single-Row Functions**

- **Calculate Age of Employees**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, FLOOR(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, BirthDate) / 12) AS Age
  FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Format Salary with Currency Symbol**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, TO_CHAR(Salary, '$99,999.00') AS FormattedSalary
  FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Extract Year and Month from Hire Date**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM HireDate) AS HireYear, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM HireDate) AS HireMonth
  FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Concatenate Full Name and Department**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, d.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
  ```

#### 4.6 **Set Operations**

- **Union: List of All Unique Employees and Project Managers**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees
  UNION
  SELECT DISTINCT e.FirstName, e.LastName
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
  WHERE ep.Role = 'Project Manager';
  ```

- **Intersect: Employees Working on 'Project A' and 'Project B'**

  ```sql
  SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
  WHERE ep.ProjectID = 201
  INTERSECT
  SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID
  WHERE ep.ProjectID = 202;
  ```

- **Minus: Employees Not Assigned to Any Project**

  ```sql
  SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName
  FROM Employees e
  MINUS
  SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Employee_Projects ep ON e.EmployeeID = ep.EmployeeID;
  ```

- **Union All: Combine All Tasks Across Projects**

  ```sql
  SELECT TaskName, Status FROM Tasks
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'No Task' AS TaskName, 'N/A' AS Status
  FROM Projects
  WHERE ProjectID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT ProjectID FROM Tasks);
  ```

#### 4.7 **Analytical Functions**

- **Rank Employees by Salary**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary,
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
  FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Cumulative Salary by Department**

  ```sql
  SELECT DepartmentName, FirstName, LastName, Salary,
         SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentName ORDER BY Salary) AS CumulativeSalary
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Running Total of Salaries**

  ```sql
  SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary,
         SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningTotal
  FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Percentage of Total Salary by Department**

  ```sql
  SELECT DepartmentName, FirstName, LastName, Salary,
         100 * Salary / SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentName) AS SalaryPercentage
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
  ```

- **Lead and Lag Functions: Compare Salaries**

  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary,
         LAG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary) AS PreviousSalary,
         LEAD(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary) AS NextSalary
  FROM Employees;
  ```

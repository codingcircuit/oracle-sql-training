# Oracle SQL Assignment: Project-Specific Scenarios

## Scenario Overview

You are tasked with analyzing data from a company database to generate various reports. The database consists of several tables related to employees, departments, and sales. Your goal is to use SQL functions to extract, manipulate, and analyze this data effectively.

## Tables and Sample Data

### Employees Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR2(50),
    hire_date DATE,
    salary NUMBER,
    dept_id NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary, dept_id) VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', DATE '2020-01-15', 7000, 10);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary, dept_id) VALUES (2, 'Bob Smith', DATE '2019-03-22', 8500, 20);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary, dept_id) VALUES (3, 'Carol Davis', DATE '2021-06-30', 6000, 10);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary, dept_id) VALUES (4, 'David Brown', DATE '2018-12-10', 7500, 30);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary, dept_id) VALUES (5, 'Eva White', DATE '2022-01-01', 6500, 20);
```

### Departments Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR2(50)
);

INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (10, 'HR');
INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (20, 'Finance');
INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (30, 'IT');
```

### Sales Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id NUMBER,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, emp_id, sale_date, amount) VALUES (1, 1, DATE '2024-07-15', 1200);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, emp_id, sale_date, amount) VALUES (2, 2, DATE '2024-07-18', 2000);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, emp_id, sale_date, amount) VALUES (3, 3, DATE '2024-07-20', 1500);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, emp_id, sale_date, amount) VALUES (4, 4, DATE '2024-07-25', 1800);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, emp_id, sale_date, amount) VALUES (5, 5, DATE '2024-07-30', 1700);
```

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Data Retrieval

1. **Employee List**: Write a query to retrieve a list of all employees, including their names, salaries, and departments.
2. **High Salary Employees**: Write a query to find all employees with a salary greater than $7,000, including their names and salaries.
3. **Hire Date**: Retrieve the names of employees who were hired in the year 2022.
4. **Employee by Department**: Get a list of employees and their hire dates for the 'Finance' department.
5. **Sales by Employee**: Retrieve the total sales amount for each employee.

### 2. Aggregation

1. **Average Salary**: Write a query to find the average salary of employees in each department.
2. **Maximum Sale**: Find the maximum sale amount recorded in the sales table.
3. **Department Count**: Count the number of employees in each department.
4. **Total Sales by Department**: Calculate the total sales amount for employees in each department.
5. **Sales Summary**: Provide a summary of the number of sales and total amount per employee.

### 3. Data Transformation

1. **Salary Increase**: Increase the salary of employees in the 'HR' department by 10% and display their names and new salaries.
2. **Formatted Names**: Retrieve a list of employee names with the first letter capitalized and the rest in lowercase.
3. **Sale Date Month**: Retrieve sales records with the month of the sale date formatted as 'YYYY-MM'.
4. **Employee Age**: Calculate the age of employees based on their hire date (assume current date as `2024-08-01`).
5. **Concatenate Data**: Concatenate employee names with their department names in a single string.

### 4. Advanced Queries

1. **Employees with Sales**: Find employees who have made at least one sale, including their names and total sales amount.
2. **Top Sales Performer**: Identify the employee with the highest total sales amount.
3. **Department Salary Comparison**: Compare the average salary of employees in the 'HR' department with that of the 'Finance' department.
4. **Sales Trend**: Display sales data for the last 30 days, showing total sales per day.
5. **Employee Performance**: Rank employees based on their total sales amount and display their ranks.

## Solutions

### 1. Data Retrieval

```sql
-- 1. Employee List
SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 2. High Salary Employees
SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 7000;

-- 3. Hire Date
SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) = 2022;

-- 4. Employee by Department
SELECT e.emp_name, e.hire_date
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.dept_name = 'Finance';

-- 5. Sales by Employee
SELECT e.emp_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales s
JOIN employees e ON s.emp_id = e.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name;
```

### 2. Aggregation

```sql
-- 1. Average Salary
SELECT d.dept_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary

JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;

-- 2. Maximum Sale
SELECT MAX(amount) AS max_sale
FROM sales;

-- 3. Department Count
SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(e.emp_id) AS employee_count
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;

-- 4. Total Sales by Department
SELECT d.dept_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales s
JOIN employees e ON s.emp_id = e.emp_id
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;

-- 5. Sales Summary
SELECT e.emp_name, COUNT(s.sale_id) AS num_sales, SUM(s.amount) AS total_amount
FROM sales s
JOIN employees e ON s.emp_id = e.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name;
```

### 3. Data Transformation

```sql
-- 1. Salary Increase
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE dept_id = (SELECT dept_id FROM departments WHERE dept_name = 'HR');

-- 2. Formatted Names
SELECT INITCAP(emp_name) AS formatted_name
FROM employees;

-- 3. Sale Date Month
SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS sale_month, amount
FROM sales;

-- 4. Employee Age
SELECT emp_name, FLOOR(MONTHS_BETWEEN(TRUNC(SYSDATE), hire_date) / 12) AS age
FROM employees;

-- 5. Concatenate Data
SELECT emp_name || ' - ' || d.dept_name AS emp_dept_info
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### 4. Advanced Queries

```sql
-- 1. Employees with Sales
SELECT e.emp_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
FROM employees e
JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name
HAVING SUM(s.amount) > 0;

-- 2. Top Sales Performer
SELECT e.emp_name
FROM employees e
JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name
ORDER BY SUM(s.amount) DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;

-- 3. Department Salary Comparison
WITH avg_salaries AS (
    SELECT d.dept_name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    GROUP BY d.dept_name
)
SELECT dept_name, avg_salary
FROM avg_salaries
WHERE dept_name IN ('HR', 'Finance');

-- 4. Sales Trend
SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS sale_day, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date > SYSDATE - 30
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
ORDER BY sale_day;

-- 5. Employee Performance
SELECT e.emp_name, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.amount) DESC) AS rank
FROM sales s
JOIN employees e ON s.emp_id = e

.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name;
```

## Introduction to Triggers

Triggers are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table or view. They are defined to perform actions before or after data manipulation operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

## Types of Triggers

### BEFORE Triggers

**BEFORE** triggers execute before the specified DML operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is performed. They are commonly used to validate data or perform preprocessing tasks.

**Syntax:**
```plsql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
    -- Trigger body
END;
```

**Example:**
```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_insert_trigger
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.hire_date := SYSDATE;
END;
```
In this example, the trigger sets the `hire_date` to the current date before inserting a new record into the `employees` table.

### AFTER Triggers

**AFTER** triggers execute after the specified DML operation is completed. They are useful for performing tasks that depend on the successful completion of the DML operation.

**Syntax:**
```plsql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
    -- Trigger body
END;
```

**Example:**
```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER after_update_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
    VALUES (:OLD.employee_id, :OLD.salary, :NEW.salary, SYSDATE);
END;
```
In this example, the trigger logs changes in the `salary` field to an `audit_log` table after an update operation on the `employees` table.

### INSTEAD OF Triggers

**INSTEAD OF** triggers are used to perform a different action in place of the specified DML operation. They are commonly used with views to perform DML operations on underlying tables.

**Syntax:**
```plsql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
INSTEAD OF INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON view_name
BEGIN
    -- Trigger body
END;
```

**Example:**
```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER instead_of_insert_trigger
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON employee_view
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date)
    VALUES (:NEW.employee_id, :NEW.first_name, :NEW.last_name, :NEW.hire_date);
END;
```
In this example, the trigger performs an INSERT into the `employees` table instead of inserting into the `employee_view`.

## Trigger Timing and Events

Triggers can be fired in response to various events:

- **INSERT**: Fired when a new row is inserted.
- **UPDATE**: Fired when an existing row is modified.
- **DELETE**: Fired when a row is deleted.

Triggers can also be defined to fire **BEFORE** or **AFTER** the event occurs, depending on whether you want to perform actions before or after the actual DML operation.

## Trigger Syntax

Here's a general syntax for creating a trigger:

```plsql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE} ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
    -- Trigger body
END;
```

### Components:
- **`trigger_name`**: The name of the trigger.
- **`BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF`**: Specifies when the trigger should fire.
- **`INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE`**: Specifies the DML operation that triggers the execution.
- **`FOR EACH ROW`**: Specifies that the trigger should execute once for each affected row (if omitted, the trigger executes once per statement).
- **Trigger Body**: Contains the PL/SQL code to be executed.

## Trigger Example

**Example: Preventing Insertion of Future Dates**

This trigger prevents the insertion of records with future dates into the `employees` table.

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER prevent_future_dates
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.hire_date > SYSDATE THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Hire date cannot be in the future.');
    END IF;
END;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize Trigger Complexity**: Keep trigger logic as simple and efficient as possible to avoid performance issues.
2. **Avoid Recursive Triggers**: Be cautious of triggers that may cause recursion, leading to unintended behavior or infinite loops.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test triggers in a controlled environment to ensure they behave as expected and do not cause unintended side effects.
4. **Use Triggers Judiciously**: Use triggers when necessary and avoid overusing them, as they can complicate debugging and maintenance.
5. **Document Triggers**: Document the purpose and behavior of each trigger to facilitate maintenance and future development.

## Use Cases

Triggers in PL/SQL are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute when certain events occur on a table or view. They are valuable for maintaining data integrity, automating system tasks, and enforcing business rules. This document provides detailed use cases and examples to illustrate how triggers can be used effectively in Oracle databases.

## Use Cases for Triggers

### Data Validation

**Use Case: Enforcing Date Constraints**

You can use triggers to enforce business rules and data constraints that cannot be enforced using constraints alone. For example, you might want to ensure that dates in a certain column are not in the future.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER validate_hire_date
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.hire_date > SYSDATE THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Hire date cannot be in the future.');
    END IF;
END;
```

### Automated Data Changes

**Use Case: Automatically Updating a Timestamp**

Triggers can automatically update a timestamp column whenever a record is inserted or updated. This is useful for tracking when data was last modified.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER update_last_modified
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.last_modified := SYSDATE;
END;
```

### Enforcing Business Rules

**Use Case: Calculating Discount Based on Quantity**

Suppose you have a business rule that applies a discount if a certain quantity is purchased. You can use triggers to apply this discount automatically.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER apply_discount
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.quantity > 10 THEN
        :NEW.discount := 0.10;  -- Apply a 10% discount
    ELSE
        :NEW.discount := 0;
    END IF;
END;
```

### Auditing Changes

**Use Case: Logging Changes to an Audit Table**

Triggers can be used to log changes to an audit table, recording who made the changes and when they were made.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER audit_employee_changes
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date, changed_by)
    VALUES (
        CASE
            WHEN INSERTING THEN 'INSERT'
            WHEN UPDATING THEN 'UPDATE'
            WHEN DELETING THEN 'DELETE'
        END,
        :OLD.employee_id,
        :OLD.salary,
        :NEW.salary,
        SYSDATE,
        USER
    );
END;
```

### Preventing Invalid Operations

**Use Case: Preventing Deletion of Certain Records**

You might want to prevent the deletion of records from a table under specific conditions. A trigger can enforce such restrictions.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER prevent_deletion
BEFORE DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :OLD.department_id = 10 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, 'Cannot delete employees from department 10.');
    END IF;
END;
```

### Synchronizing Data

**Use Case: Maintaining Data Consistency Across Tables**

Triggers can be used to keep data consistent between related tables. For example, if you have a summary table that needs to reflect changes in a detail table, a trigger can help synchronize them.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER sync_summary_table
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON order_details
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING OR UPDATING THEN
        UPDATE order_summary
        SET total_amount = (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM order_details WHERE order_id = :NEW.order_id)
        WHERE order_id = :NEW.order_id;
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        UPDATE order_summary
        SET total_amount = (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM order_details WHERE order_id = :OLD.order_id)
        WHERE order_id = :OLD.order_id;
    END IF;
END;
```

## Trigger Examples

### Preventing Future Dates

This trigger ensures that the `hire_date` for new employees is not set to a future date.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER prevent_future_dates
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.hire_date > SYSDATE THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Hire date cannot be in the future.');
    END IF;
END;
```

### Logging Changes

This trigger logs every change to the `employees` table into an audit log, capturing old and new salary values.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER log_salary_changes
AFTER UPDATE OF salary ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO salary_audit_log (employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
    VALUES (:OLD.employee_id, :OLD.salary, :NEW.salary, SYSDATE);
END;
```

### Preventing Duplicate Entries

This trigger prevents duplicate entries in the `employees` table by ensuring that an employee cannot be inserted with the same `email`.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER prevent_duplicate_email
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE email = :NEW.email) THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, 'An employee with this email already exists.');
    END IF;
END;
```

### Automatic Data Transformation

This trigger automatically capitalizes the first letter of `first_name` and `last_name` before inserting a new record.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER capitalize_names
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.first_name := INITCAP(:NEW.first_name);
    :NEW.last_name := INITCAP(:NEW.last_name);
END;
```

### Complex Business Logic

This trigger enforces complex business rules, such as restricting salary increases based on certain criteria.

**Example:**

```plsql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER salary_increase_restriction
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.salary > :OLD.salary * 1.20 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20003, 'Salary increase cannot exceed 20% of the current salary.');
    END IF;
END;
```

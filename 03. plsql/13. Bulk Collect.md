# 13. BULK COLLECT

`BULK COLLECT` is a powerful feature in PL/SQL used to retrieve multiple rows of data from a SQL query into a PL/SQL collection in one operation. This improves performance by reducing the number of context switches between the SQL and PL/SQL engines.

## Overview

`BULK COLLECT` allows you to fetch multiple rows from a query into PL/SQL collections (such as associative arrays, nested tables, or VARRAYs) in a single operation. This can significantly enhance performance, especially for large result sets, by minimizing the number of context switches between SQL and PL/SQL.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_list
INTO collection
FROM table
[WHERE condition];
```

Or, with multiple collections:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
INTO collection1, collection2
FROM table
[WHERE condition];
```

You can also use `BULK COLLECT` with `LIMIT` to control the number of rows fetched in each iteration:

```sql
SELECT column_list
BULK COLLECT INTO collection
FROM table
[WHERE condition]
LIMIT n;
```

## Use Cases

1. **Fetching Large Result Sets**
   - **Scenario**: You need to retrieve a large number of rows from a table for processing in PL/SQL.
   - **Benefit**: `BULK COLLECT` allows you to fetch all rows at once, reducing the number of context switches and improving performance.

2. **Handling Complex Queries**
   - **Scenario**: You need to execute a complex query involving joins or aggregations and process the results in PL/SQL.
   - **Benefit**: `BULK COLLECT` can handle complex queries and efficiently load the results into PL/SQL collections.

3. **Pagination of Results**
   - **Scenario**: You need to process and display results in smaller chunks or pages.
   - **Benefit**: Using `BULK COLLECT` with `LIMIT`, you can fetch and process results in manageable chunks.

4. **Multiple Collections Retrieval**
   - **Scenario**: You need to retrieve and store results from a query into multiple PL/SQL collections simultaneously.
   - **Benefit**: `BULK COLLECT` supports fetching data into multiple collections in one operation.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Bulk Collect

**Description:**
Retrieve multiple rows from a table into a PL/SQL collection.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees emp_table;
BEGIN
    SELECT * BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees FROM employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example 2: Bulk Collect into a PL/SQL Table

**Description:**
Retrieve data into a PL/SQL table type.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
    v_employees emp_table;
BEGIN
    SELECT * BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees FROM employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN v_employees.FIRST .. v_employees.LAST LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example 3: Bulk Collect with LIMIT Clause

**Description:**
Retrieve data in chunks using the LIMIT clause.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees emp_table;
    v_limit CONSTANT INTEGER := 100; -- Number of rows to fetch in each batch
BEGIN
    OPEN cur_employees FOR SELECT * FROM employees;
    
    LOOP
        FETCH cur_employees BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees LIMIT v_limit;
        
        EXIT WHEN v_employees.COUNT = 0;
        
        -- Process batch
        FOR i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT LOOP
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
        END LOOP;
    END LOOP;
    
    CLOSE cur_employees;
END;
/
```

### Example 4: Bulk Collect with a Cursor

**Description:**
Use `BULK COLLECT` with an explicit cursor.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    CURSOR cur_employees IS
        SELECT * FROM employees;
        
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF cur_employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees emp_table;
BEGIN
    OPEN cur_employees;
    FETCH cur_employees BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees;
    CLOSE cur_employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example 5: Handling Exceptions with Bulk Collect

**Description:**
Handle exceptions during bulk collection.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees emp_table;
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        SELECT * BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees FROM employees;
        
        -- Process data
        FOR i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT LOOP
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
        END LOOP;
        
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
    END;
END;
/
```

### Example 6: Bulk Collect with Multiple Collections

**Description:**
Retrieve data into multiple collections.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_id_table IS TABLE OF employees.emp_id%TYPE;
    TYPE emp_name_table IS TABLE OF employees.emp_name%TYPE;
    
    v_emp_ids emp_id_table;
    v_emp_names emp_name_table;
BEGIN
    SELECT emp_id, emp_name
    BULK COLLECT INTO v_emp_ids, v_emp_names
    FROM employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN 1 .. v_emp_ids.COUNT LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_ids(i) || ': ' || v_emp_names(i));
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example 7: Bulk Collect into Associative Arrays

**Description:**
Use associative arrays (index-by tables) for bulk collection.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_assoc_array IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
    v_employees emp_assoc_array;
BEGIN
    SELECT * BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees FROM employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN v_employees.FIRST .. v_employees.LAST LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example 8: Bulk Collect with Explicit Cursors

**Description:**
Fetch data into a collection using an explicit cursor with `BULK COLLECT`.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    CURSOR cur_employees IS
        SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employees;
        
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF cur_employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees emp_table;
BEGIN
    OPEN cur_employees;
    FETCH cur_employees BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees;
    CLOSE cur_employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example 9: Bulk Collect and FORALL

**Description:**
Use `FORALL` to perform bulk DML operations after bulk collecting data.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees emp_table;
BEGIN
    SELECT * BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees FROM employees;
    
    FORALL i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT
        UPDATE employees
        SET emp_name = 'Processed ' || v_employees(i).emp_name
        WHERE emp_id = v_employees(i).emp_id;
        
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

### Example 10: Bulk Collect with Dynamic SQL

**Description:**
Use `BULK COLLECT` with dynamic SQL.

**Code:**

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
    v_employees

 emp_table;
    v_sql VARCHAR2(1000);
BEGIN
    v_sql := 'SELECT * FROM employees';
    
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql BULK COLLECT INTO v_employees;
    
    -- Process data
    FOR i IN 1 .. v_employees.COUNT LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employees(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

## Best Practices

- **Use LIMIT Wisely**: When handling large datasets, use the `LIMIT` clause to control the number of rows fetched in each iteration to avoid memory issues.
- **Minimize Context Switches**: `BULK COLLECT` helps minimize context switches between SQL and PL/SQL, but itâ€™s essential to balance it with proper exception handling and resource management.
- **Index Collections**: For large collections, consider using indexing to improve performance during data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Handle Exceptions**: Always include exception handling to manage errors that may occur during bulk operations.

By leveraging `BULK COLLECT`, you can significantly enhance the performance of PL/SQL blocks that deal with large volumes of data. Understanding and applying best practices ensures efficient and effective use of this powerful feature.
